Cryosphere Community Datapool Tools (`ccdtools`)
=========================================

Welcome to the Cryosphere Community Datapool Tools (ccdtools) documentation!

The Cryosphere Community Datapool (CCD) is a joint project between `ACCESS-NRI <https://www.access-nri.org.au/>`_ and the `Cryospheric Sciences Working Group (CSWG) <https://forum.access-hive.org.au/c/cryosphere/34>`_. 
The CCD has been designed as an open-access and freely available cryospheric data resource for the community, and houses a variety of datasets commonly used 
to parameterise ice sheet models. 

This documentation describes the CCD Python library developed by `ACCESS-NRI <https://www.access-nri.org.au/>`_ that provides seamless access to 
a curated collection of cryosphere-related community datasets hosted on the National Computational Infrastructure's Gadi 
supercomputer project `av17`. Designed for the Australian cryosphere community, CCD offers an intuitive interface for discovering, 
accessing, and analysing diverse data sources including satellite observations, in-situ measurements, and model outputs. 
The library features a powerful dataset catalog system, enabling researchers, educators, and practitioners to efficiently 
retrieve and work with data commonly used for ice sheet modeling, climate analysis, and other cryospheric studies. 

As an open-source project, CCD encourages contributions from the community to expand its dataset offerings and enhance functionality.

Please see the `ACCESS-Hive Docs CCD page <https://docs.access-hive.org.au/model_evaluation/data/cryosphere_datapool/>`_ for a full list and description of all available datasets.
