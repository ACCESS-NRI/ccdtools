Cryosphere Community Datapool (CCD)
=========================================

Welcome to the Cryosphere Community Datapool (access-cryosphere-data-pool) documentation!

The Cryosphere Community Datapool (CCD) is a Python library developed by ACCESS-NRI that provides seamless access to 
a curated collection of cryosphere-related community datasets hosted on the National Computational Infrastructure's Gadi 
supercomputer project `av17`. Designed for the Australian cryosphere community, CCD offers an intuitive interface for discovering, 
accessing, and analysing diverse data sources including satellite observations, in-situ measurements, and model outputs. 
The library features a powerful dataset catalog system, enabling researchers, educators, and practitioners to efficiently 
retrieve and work with data commonly used for ice sheet modeling, climate analysis, and other cryospheric studies. 

As an open-source project, CCD encourages contributions from the community to expand its dataset offerings and enhance functionality.

Please see the `ACCESS-Hive Docs CCD page <https://docs.access-hive.org.au/model_evaluation/data/cryosphere_datapool/>`_ for a full list and desription of each dataset included.
